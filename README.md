# Preview-Sublime-Text-2-Syntax
Useful for creating custom syntax settings. All the files needed to get a visual on what colours apply to what names.

## How to use the files
Preview_list.md can go anywhere, just open this and apply the syntax "Preview Syntax Colours" from Sublimes View -> Syntax

Everything else goes into a folder called "Preview Syntax Colours" in your sublime's syntax folder.

Not sure where/what the syntax folder is? Follow the tutorial linked below
